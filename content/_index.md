# Hi ðŸ‘‹! I am Pragyansh

**Welcome to my portfolio/blog!**

I like messing with operating systems, build tools, security and system software. I also like to write about my learnings and share them with the world.

I am a Software Engineer at Canonical, working on maintaining Ubuntu for the Raspberry Pi. I am also an [Ubuntu Contributing Developer](https://launchpad.net/~r41k0u).

This place is a collection of my thoughts, ideas, and projects.
